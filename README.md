Generate a self-signed CA

Note: In a production setting you will not perform this step. You will use your
company CA or a valid public CA.

This section demonstrates to how you can create your own self-signed CA and
then use this CA to sign server certificates. This CA can be thought of as a
Company IT internal CA that is self-signed and whose CA certificates are
deployed on the company machines. This way the server certificate becomes
legitimate.

export EXAMPLE_CA_KEY_FILE='example-CA.key'
export EXAMPLE_CA_CERT_FILE='example-CA.crt'
openssl req -x509 -batch -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out "${EXAMPLE_CA_CERT_FILE}" \
-keyout "${EXAMPLE_CA_KEY_FILE}" \
-subj "/C=UK/O=hp/CN=Autogenerated Helion Certificate Authority" \
-days 365

You can tweak the subj and days above to your needs. For instance, if you want
to test what happens when a CA expires, you can keep 'days' to very low values.

Note that the issuer has to be unique. So if you already installed a CA for a
particular DN (subj), make sure it's different the next time. For example:

-subj "/C=UK/O=hp/CN=Autogenerated Helion Certificate Authority 2" \
